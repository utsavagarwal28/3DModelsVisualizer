This is a simple Unity project made to display and explore 3D models in a scene. It allows you to rotate around models, zoom in/out, and switch between different models using a basic UI.

You can use this to:
  1) Show your 3D models to others
  2) Present models for educational purposes
  3) Use in-game for information or asset visualization
  4) Help labeling teams view models from different angles for annotation/reference
  5) Preview assets before using them in a full project
